## Disclaimer

There is no active development on this plugin. I am having a roadmap with features I would love to use in my own projects. 
But there is, and will be, no timeline for completion.

## Roadmap

- ~~duplicate entries~~ (done)
- copy and paste an entry to another position in the same or another entry type (experimental, in progress)
- copy and paste an entry to another section
- drag and drop between entry types
