- ~~duplicate entries~~ (done)
- copy and paste an entry to another position in the same or another entry type (experimental, in progress)
- copy and paste an entry to another section (experimental, in progress)
- "Add Block Above" Neo-style
- cut and paste an entry
  - easier than drag and drop implementation
  - "delete" only after paste
- drag and drop between entry types
